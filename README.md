# Trivia-Project
A team project involving myself and two other software engineers with the goal in mind of replacing obsolete, expensive trivia software and buzzers. We used Python to run the game loop and store the Players scores in a file. We also integrated Raspberry Pi to control the buzzers. Even more important than the technical coding parts of the project, I gained valuable experience in going through the software development process working as part of a team and successfully meeting deadlines. Note that this code is INCOMPLETE and only consists of the work completed by me and two other students. The project was then taken on and completed by next year's class.
